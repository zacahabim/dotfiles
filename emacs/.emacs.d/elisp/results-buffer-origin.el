;;; results-buffer-origin.el --- Jump to quickfix-like target window -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Vim-quickfix-like behavior: selecting a match in *xref*, *grep*,
;; *rg*, or *compilation* buffers displays the target in the last
;; "normal" editing window you focused (not a results buffer, not
;; the minibuffer) — kept continuously up to date, not just the
;; window the search was started from. Switch to a different edit
;; window before picking the next match, and results now land there
;; instead. If that window is no longer live, falls back to normal
;; `display-buffer' behavior (free to pick or create a new pane).
